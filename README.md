👋 Hi, I’m Zakaria EL Houari (@Airakaz01) - a Final-year Engineering Student in Computer Science and Data Engineering at ENSA Khouribga.

👀 I’m passionate about building robust Data & AI solutions, from scalable **Data Engineering** pipelines to impactful **Machine Learning** models. I thrive on extracting strategic insights and leveraging my full-stack development skills to create data-driven applications.

🌱 I’m currently:
*   Developing a **Deep Learning Computer Vision pipeline** for strategic image analysis (PFE - SC-INC), involving object detection (**YOLOv8**) and classification (**PyTorch**) on large annotated datasets.
*   Building a full-stack **Intelligent Web Platform** (React, Spring Boot, MySQL) featuring an **AI-based CV-offer recommendation system** (CODEX project), where I've implemented ML/NLP models and contributed to MLOps strategy.
*   Designing and implementing **Data Pipelines (ETL)** and **Business Intelligence solutions** with Power BI, SQL Server, and SSIS/SSAS for predictive maintenance and deep data analysis.
*   Honing my skills as a **Full-Stack Developer Intern at TSUNAMI IT**, contributing to an online multiplayer game using Angular, ASP.NET, and SQL Server.
*   Leading the **Technical Cell at CODEX ENSA Khouribga**, fostering skills in IT and Data Engineering among students.

💞️ I’m looking for challenging **PFE internship opportunities** (6 months, starting Feb 2026) in:
*   **Data Science & AI Engineering** (focus on ML/DL, NLP, Computer Vision, Generative AI)
*   **Data Engineering & Big Data Architectures** (with Python, Spark, Apache Kafka, Cloud platforms)
*   **Data Analytics & Business Intelligence** (leveraging Power BI, SQL for actionable insights)
I am particularly keen on impactful projects that blend cutting-edge AI with robust data foundations.

⚡ Fun fact: Beyond optimizing deep learning models, I actually developed a complete multiplayer online Scrabble game! I'm also always eager to explore new tools like Apache Kafka or n8n for data automation.
